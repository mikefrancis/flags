flags
=====

Flags of the world generated in CSS. 

Shouldn't really be used for production at this stage as it's not browser tested and is just at a tech-demo stage, but hopefully if we can grow the collection of flags then we can refactor using a CSS pre-processor.

## Contributing

I've created a JSFiddle with a link to the rawgit.com version of the CSS file, so this should be synched to the repo. This means you can test your flags without creating extra files, and I'll update the fiddle with more flags as we go.
