flags
=====

Flags of the world generated using CSS gradients.

This is more of a tech-demo rather than a library due to the lack of browser support for Internet Explorer (if you're not supporting IE 9 then be my guest!).

## Support

* Chrome 10.0 +
* Firefox 3.6 +
* Internet Explorer 10 +

[More CSS gradient browser support](http://caniuse.com/css-gradients)

## Contributing

I've created a JSFiddle with a link to the rawgit.com version of the CSS file, so this should be synched to the repo. This means you can test your flags without creating extra files, and I'll update the fiddle with more flags as we go.
